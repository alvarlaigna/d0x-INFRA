# d0x-INFRA
Tutorials and explanations of d0x-INFRA modules and libraries. This repository also serves as a central place to submit requests to create new modules.

Currently, we recognise 4 different d0x-INFRA categories:
### [district-server-module](https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Adistrict-server-module+org%3Adistrict0x&type=Repositories)
[Mount](https://github.com/tolitius/mount) modules for server-side logic of a district.

### [district-ui-module](https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Adistrict-ui-module+org%3Adistrict0x&type=Repositories)
[Mount](https://github.com/tolitius/mount) + [re-frame](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame) modules for fontend-side logic of a district.

### [district-ui-component](https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Adistrict-library+org%3Adistrict0x&type=Repositories)
[Reagent](https://github.com/reagent-project/reagent) or [React](https://reactjs.org/) visual component in a district UI. 


### [district-library](https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Adistrict-library+org%3Adistrict0x&type=Repositories)
Stateless libraries that provide set of helpful functions. A district library is meant to be used for building a district and usually it's too opinionated or incomplete to be general purpose Clojurescript library. 

A d0x-INFRA repository may be tagged with multiple d0x-INFRA categories, since code in a repository can be written in a way that it provides multiple of them, depending on usage context. 

*More documentation coming soon.*
